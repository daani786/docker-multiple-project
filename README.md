# VM Setup
- Install Ubuntu server Vm
- Install following packages in ubuntu
-- ssh
-- Docker 
-- docker compose
-- nano
- check vm ip, e.g. 192.168.139.129
- share you full work directory with vm, the shared folder can be access as /mnt/hgfs/work
# Docker Container Management
- we use ubuntu server therefore we need alternate to decoker desktop which is portainer 
- install portainer container so other containers can be manager easily from browser
- login into ssh of vm
- go to path /mnt/hgfs/work/docker/portainer
- and run "docker compose up -d"
- portainer will install and ready to use
- open https://192.168.139.129:9443 in browser and create user in it
# Main Docker
- You need one folder where you can put your docker with common items
-- Nginx
-- Mysql 5.7
-- Mysql 8.0
-- Phpmyadmin
- set phpmyadmin VIRTUAL_HOST to access it in host machine browser "phpmyadmin.local"
- go to path /mnt/hgfs/work/docker/main
- and run "docker compose up -d"
- add this host into host machine's hosts file with vm ip
-- 192.168.139.129 phpmyadmin.local
- after successful run you can check phpmyadmin.local in your browser
- enter following details in the form to access mysql
- server = leave it empty
- username = root
- password = root123
- Server choice = select mysql server you want to access
- it will load, now create database for project that will be accessible in respective project
- Note: network should be same in all projects "web_proxy" to access mysql in them
# Project Alpha
- it is simple project, it is not necessary to put project in this folder, it can be anywhere.
- set code path e.g. ./src:/var/www/html
- /var/www/html is the container path where from index will load when we access it in browser
- set the VIRTUAL_HOST as your needs e.g. alpha.local
- add alpha.local in hosts file of host system
-- 192.168.139.129 alpha.local
- go to path /mnt/hgfs/work/docker/project-alpha
- and run "docker compose up -d"
- open in browser http://alpha.local
- it will load the index file project-alpha\project-alpha-code\src\index.html in browser
# Project Laravel
- it is not simple project, because its execution point is not main folder that we shared with container, but it start execution from public folder
- the file 000-default.conf will define the execution of project "/var/www/html/public" instead of "/var/www/html"
- in this compose we will not use the image like in project alpha, but we will use Dockerfile
- set the project path and 000-default.conf in compose.yaml
-- ./src:/var/www/html
-- ./000-default.conf:/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
- set the VIRTUAL_HOST as your needs e.g. laravel.local
- add laravel.local in hosts file of host system
-- 192.168.139.129 laravel.local
- set docker file path and context in compose.yaml
-- build:
-- context: .
-- dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
- the docker file will do the following:-
-- get image from php:8.3-apache
-- install composer
-- install apache2 rewrite module
-- install git, zip
-- library to access mysql
-- enables the specified site 000-default.conf
- go to path /mnt/hgfs/work/docker/project-alpha
- and run "docker compose up -d"
- open in browser http://laravel.local
- it will load the index file project-laravel\project-laravel-code\src\public\index.html in browser
